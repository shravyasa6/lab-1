Experiment Title: Performance Analysis of Matrix Multiplication using Sequential, OpenMP.

1) Abstract Abstract This experiment compares sequential and OpenMP implementations of 4000 × 4000 matrix multiplication. The sequential program took 348.02 seconds, while the OpenMP implementation using 8 threads reduced the execution time to 132.46 seconds, achieving a 2.63 × speedup. Both implementations produced the correct result, C [ 0 ] [ 0 ] = 4000.00 . The results demonstrate the performance improvement achieved through shared-memory parallelism using OpenMP.

2) Experimental Objectives To implement 4000 × 4000 matrix multiplication using Sequential C and OpenMP. To verify the correctness of the result by confirming C [ 0 ] [ 0 ] = 4000.00 . To measure the execution time of both implementations and calculate the speedup of OpenMP over the sequential program. To compare the performance of single-threaded execution with 8-thread OpenMP parallel execution. To analyze the performance improvement achieved through shared-memory parallelism using OpenMP.
